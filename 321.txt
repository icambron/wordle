i dont need vowels so maybe

notch*
cloth

postmortem: notch did not turn out to be very good. you need a U to deal with value/vague/gauze/gauge/etc. NYT used gulch

well that was unhelpful

LABLE
FABLE
GABLE
MAUVE
GAUGE

im sure there are zillions. i want a u but cant think of a good one.

blimp*

Postmortem: still need the U. i was indeed missing a ton of words. NYT likes BULGE; i didnt consider anything without 4 novel consonants.

BADGE

all i can think of

yay

postmortem: this was the only one. overall, missed a lot of words and didnt look hard enough for good search words.

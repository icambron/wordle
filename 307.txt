Just the A. Not much here. Going with COUNT

(postmortem...nyt likes CLOUT here, creates significantly more groups, not sure how I'd ever figure that out though)

after 2

probably <cons><cons>ANT
could also be A*ANT...does AVANT count? It's french but we use "avant-garde"

PLANT *

I guess...I guess that it?

QUANT - I don't think this is really a word


(yay!)

(postmortem - was indeed the only word. nyt gave me a 94)

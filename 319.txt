CHART seems good. C, H, T, attempt to locate A and R. Could probably do better by not using R (CHANT is an obvious option)

postmortem: NYT did not like CHART (72) or CHANT (74). GLAND is their choice and it is indeed awesome. But very hard to figure that out.

I've got:

TRAIL*
TRAIN

If I'd done CHANT, I'd know now. So there's that.

postmortem: these were the only two

I guess it's TRAIN

hhmm, so...

draft
flint *

(postmortem: nytimes not a fan of FLINT, which they gave a 71 to, probably the worst score they've given me. That's because I missed lots of stuff, like CIGAR, ACRID, DIARY, VICAR that wouldn't have gotten split up by FLINT, so big difference in the probability of landing in 3. They like GLAND, which I would have liked to, but not specifically more than FLINT. They also like DRAFT quite a bit (92), which I passed on.)

flair *

pretty much the only choice

(postmortem - a little luck here, but nothing crazy)

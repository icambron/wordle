raise -> count -> glyph

this is probably one of those places where there are only a few words but I can't search it effectively. Wide and sparse.

postmortem: this was right. COUNT was v good according to nyt but GLYPH was splitting just seven words, words i dont think i would have been able to generate. So they gave me a 70 necause it doesn't split WORRY/DOWRY/WORDY but I'm actually happy there. GLYPH was both analytically easy and relatively good

after 3
------

just combinatoric search through the possibilites, but twice because i missed it the first time. FORGO is pronounced FOREGO so i said it wrong in my head. But anyway, going with that.

yay

Postmortem: forgo was the only word. 90 overall

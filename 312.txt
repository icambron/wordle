going with count

(postmortem: this was fine. nyt gave a 95, preferred PLONK)

sno**
s*oon

lots of s endings and probably some Y endings, but presumably mostly excluded from the word list

hard to find not s-at-start patterns without exotica

SPOON *
SWOON

all i can think of

(postmortem: missed snowy, synod (!!) and obviously shown. was right about s at start. Didnt know we did Y adverbs?? spoon turns out to be the perfect guess anyway, so a little luck there. nyt gave me a 99 for it)

after 3

well, didnt get it

missed WN ending, also maybe GN

SHOWN (do they do these?)

cant think of anything else, so going for shown

(yay)

(postmortem: shown was the only possibility. nyt gave me a 98 overall, just deducting a few points for COUNT)

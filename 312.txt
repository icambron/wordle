going with count

(postmortem: this was fine. nyt gave a 95, preferred PLONK)

sno**
s*oon

lots of s endings and probably some Y endings, but presumably mostly excluded from the word list

hard to find not s-at-start patterns without exotica

SPOON *
SWOON

all i can think of

(postmortem: missed snowy, synod (!!) and obviously shown. was right about s at start. I guess snowy is an adjective so wasnt excluded on the Y-adverb rule, but isnt there a huge class of derivative Y adjectives? will need to think about those, maybe just pull up the list of included Y-endingd... spoon turns out to be the perfect guess anyway, so a little luck there. nyt gave me a 99 for it)

well, didnt get it

missed WN ending, also maybe GN

SHOWN (do they do these?)

cant think of anything else, so going for shown

(yay)

(postmortem: shown was the only possibility. nyt gave me a 98 overall, just deducting a few points for COUNT)

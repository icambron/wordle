ok, that's a lot of words, and I doubt I got them all. About half of them have an additional vowel.

count 
ghoul *
chunk (i don't like the k)
cloth

(postmortem: nytimes liked CLOTH best here, and also several other OU words like CLOUD and CLOUT. They have GHOUL a 74. And CLOTH really is a lot better, even accounting for the words I missed. I should have looked at it more closely, since I did think of it, and I like the word in general. With any analysis I'd probably have chosen it. The problem with ghoul is that there aren't that many Gs and they're correlated with U anyway, and also it's missing a T. Kind of a dumb choice tbh)

Only one that keeps with the o is:

opine *

Can I think of others?

oxide

Any *OI*E? (a la poise/noise but we don't have an s) Can't think of any

Think I'm 50/50, opine/oxide. Going opine because if i'm wrong I have a better chance of matching on on N

(postmortem: there was also OVINE and VOICE. I should have spotted OVINE. VOICE was what I was looking for but I didn't think of the C for the 4 position. Fortunately, OPINE was the correct choice anyway. Note that my rationale for choosing OPINE panned out by eliminating OVINE -- well sort of...if I'd guessed OXIDE I'd have just won)

I guess it's oxide

(postmortem: so it goes. 91 overall)

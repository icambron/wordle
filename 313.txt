raise -> count -> glyph

should have done that y-ending lookup i meant to do...

TESTY
ZESTY *

yay

v curious what i missed here

postmortem: count was too conservative, should have tried to locate the S. glyph was too consertvive and it was worth making a list there: steed, steel, steep, zesty, testy. i didnt consider double Es at all and didnt probe Y endings until after glyph. imo this one was pretty hard. 81 overall

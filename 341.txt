I don't need another vowel, so going with CLOTH

postmortem: NYC _hated_ cloth, a 41. They went with KNELT. I do need a better word with N in it that has only one vowel. KNELT is really pretty good.

steak
stead
steam
asset

so...need to sort through those last letters and check possition on s

smoke <- initial s for asset, m and k for steam and steak

postmortem: I missed SWEAT. They gave me a 78 on this because it doesn't split SWEAT and STEAD and it isn't a valid guess. Their guess STEAD doesn't split STEAK and STEAM (which is why I didn't pick it), but it is a valid guess, so with all else equal is better.

not s*

asset

postmortem: I didn't get a great score here, but I'm actually fine with my play

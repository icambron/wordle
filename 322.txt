I doubt there's a U, going with CLOTH

postmortem: NYT did not like cloth (46). Turns out there are only a handful of words here, so you can pick much more precisely. But I'd have had a really hard time generating them with that.

potmortem: bitsy is not a valid answer, so it was actually a TIPSY/MIDST tossup. So besides the (apparently) poor CLOTH, I did just fine. 86 overall.

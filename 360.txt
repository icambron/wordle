not sure I need another vowel. Let's do CHANT

postmortem: NYT gave a 70 for this. They liked BLAND. But this is exactly the place I'm never going to do any analysis. It boils down to how many words are like **[Y]** and **[G]**, which seems impossible to count. I'm happy with CHANT. 90 luck though.

ATONE*
ATUNE

Guess I did need another vowel. But is ATUNE really a word? ATUNED is, but I'm not sure how to actually use "atune".

yay!

postmortem: atone was the only one

hmm, *A*** with R and E, R not at start, and E not at end. No S or I

 * There's probably an E at the 4 spot

EAGER
LAGER
PAPER
CAPER
TAMER?
EATER?
BAKER
TAKER?
FAKER
MAKER


premably there aren't words like 

LAMER

There's no way I'm going to think of all these.

ooh, tricky one:

EARLY 


G,K,P,M

GLUMK would be a great word. English should add it forthwith.

GLUMP should be something. Sort of sounds like it is. Like LUMP and GLUM combined. A sad person in the corner.

PLANK if i lose the G...I don't have any Ns but I know I'm missing words, so that's not terrible

PLANK it is

postmortem: PLANK was one of my worst choices _ever_. I definitely missed a bunch of words. NYT used LYMPH. They gave me a 53 for PLANK. Sigh.

no dice. oh, yeah, and i should have done PLUNK or PLONK, huh? kind of dumb

carried over:

EAGER
TAMER
EATER

search for more...

WAFER
WATER
WAGER
WAVER

W,T,G
would be nice to confirm R at end

let's go with TWIGS

postmortem: this was not great either. First, I was missing a bunch: HATER, EARTH, HAREM, GAYER (really?), GAZER (oh come on), CATER (fair enough). Then those happen to be two big groups I just miss, mostly for not placing an H. They still gave me 80 for TWIGS though. EIGHT was their choice

yellow g. So that means EAGER? The very first word I thought of? Let's think more...

GAMER

so 50/50? Seems like a good chance i'm still missing one

going with EAGER

postmortem: still in play were GAYER and GAZER, which makes EAGER bad. There's a heurisic here I should have used: I didn't think of those words but missing words were more likely to start with G than E, so I should have gone with GAMER

well, not that. GAMER

yay

postmortem: could have been those other two, so this was potentially game losing. They gave me a 10, breaking the record I set above. They went with GAMEY to guarantee the win. Not my best work. 52 overall.

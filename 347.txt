We don't need more vowels, so going with CLOTH

postmortem: not a great word

Not havin the A on 2 is surprising now, especially with H gone (e.g. CHEAR)

CREA* <-- don't think this really exists
CERA* <-- this neither
CE*AR <-- like CELAR, but that's eliminated by CLOTH


CEDAR

I guess we go with that?

postmortem: Weird that I missed CREAM and CREAK. Just didn't look hard enough. Obviously if I'd thought of them, trying one of them is better, gets me next turn.

Ah, duh, I missed CREAM & CREAK from that first category. 50/50?

Tried CREAM, guess it's CREAK...

postmortem: overall, a fail

raise -> count -> glyph

postmortem: glyph wasn't great because there were only a few: blown, flown, knoll, known, nylon. I didn't really even look though. And blown (or flown) is actually the best answer there (others leave blown/flown ambiguous).

after 3

N can't go first, and O has to go after the L, so I think we have

*LO*N

like:

BLOWN*
FLOWN

I don't see any O* ones, and not much other than W can go in that penultimate spot

So I guess we go with one of those?

Yay

postmortem: those were the only two
